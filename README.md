### The Why: 
For our final project in INF 286, We were tasked to team up with two of our peers and redesign an existing website from the ground up. We chose Sustainiac's website because it appeared outdated and illogically structured, from site navigation to the actual code. We wanted to breathe new life into the website and offer a less confusing experience for the user, but we were left with virtually nothing to go off of. So, we did our research and built a top layer front-end site highlighting the company's purpose and displaying some of their products.

### Elements Improved:
- Implement external style sheets
	- Responsive
	- In-house styles
	- Proper layout of page
- Make HTML more cohesive and intuitive
	- Make use of Divs, Forms and Tables
	- Improve site navigation
	- Semantic HTML

### Instructions:
Navigate through the HTML folder and open the file named index.html
